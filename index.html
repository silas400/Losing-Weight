                    <div class="back">This refers to your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest. These functions include breathing, circulating blood, and maintaining body temperature. It’s surprising to many, but the majority of your daily energy is spent just keeping you alive. That’s why understanding your BMR is crucial for managing weight.</div>

                    <div class="back">Whether you're awake, sitting, or asleep, your body never stops working. Vital organs like your heart and brain require constant fuel. That means your body continues burning calories around the clock. Even sleep is an active metabolic state for your internal systems.</div>

That means what you do at rest plays a bigger role in your calorie burn than most realize. By increasing muscle mass or improving metabolic health, you can raise your BMR slightly over time.

Protein-rich items like eggs, chicken, and Greek yogurt burn the most calories during digestion. High-fiber vegetables such as broccoli and spinach, and whole grains like oats and brown rice, also demand more effort to break down. Spicy foods containing capsaicin, like chili peppers, can slightly raise energy expenditure, while drinks like green tea and coffee provide compounds that gently stimulate metabolism.

                    <div class="back">A calorie deficit occurs when you consume fewer calories than your body burns. This energy imbalance forces your body to tap into stored fat for fuel, leading to weight loss over time. It’s the foundational principle behind nearly every weight loss strategy.
